## Tables Created

### 1. users
- `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- `name` (User full name)

## Relationship

###2. Update a taskâ€™s status
UPDATE tasks SET status = 'completed' WHERE id = 1;
###3. Delete a task
DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = 7;
###4. Show tasks with Sorting and Limit (Pagination)
SELECT * FROM tasks ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
###5. Aggregator Functions
-- Count total tasks per user
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_tasks
FROM tasks
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Find latest task creation date per user
SELECT user_id, MAX(created_at) AS latest_task
FROM tasks
GROUP BY user_id;
###6. Joins
-- Inner Join
SELECT users.name, tasks.title, tasks.status
FROM users
INNER JOIN tasks ON users.id = tasks.user_id;

-- Left Join
SELECT users.name, tasks.title, tasks.status
FROM users
LEFT JOIN tasks ON users.id = tasks.user_id;

-- Right Join
SELECT users.name, tasks.title, tasks.status
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN tasks ON users.id = tasks.user_id;
